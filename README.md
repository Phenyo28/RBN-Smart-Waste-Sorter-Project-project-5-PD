# RBN-Smart-Waste-Sorter-Project-project-5-PD

### Introduction
This project is a prototype of a Smart Waste Sorter, an automated system designed to detect and sort waste materials into different bins using sensors and servo motors. It was developed using an ESP32 microcontroller, an ESP32-CAM, ultrasonic sensors, LEDs and servo motors to demonstrate how technology can make recycling more efficient and sustainable.

The system operates by sensing the distance of an approaching object using the ultrasonic sensor. When waste is detected, the corresponding bin lid automatically opens through the servo mechanism. This process reduces manual handling, improves hygiene, and promotes proper waste disposal practices.

### The Smart Waste Sorter prototype features:
- Ultrasonic distance detection to identify approaching waste.
- Servo motorâ€“controlled lids that open automatically based on sensor input.
- Real-time automation using the ESP32 microcontroller.
- A modular design created in Onshape for easy assembly and improvement.
